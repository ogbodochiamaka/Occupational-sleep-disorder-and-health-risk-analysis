## Introduction:
This is an Excel project report which provides a comprehensive analysis of sleep patterns, health risks, and lifestyle behaviors across various occupations. This project will help us analyze sleep disorders and their contributing factors across different occupation and health conditions. It offers data-driven insights into sleep disorders, blood pressure levels, BMI, physical activity, and stress, enabling healthcare professionals, HR teams, and wellness coordinators to make informed decisions regarding employee health and workplace wellness programs.The goal is to help organizations understand how workplace conditions influence employee health and to support data-driven wellness interventions.
## Project overview:
Sleep disorders and poor sleep quality contribute to reduced productivity, workplace errors, mental fatigue, and long-term health risks.This dashboard provides a holistic view of employee health by connecting sleep quality with lifestyle and occupational demands.The dataset includes 374 individuals across different professions with detailed demographic, sleep, and medical information.
## Problem statements:
- What problem is the Occupational Sleep Disorder & Health Risk Dashboard trying to solve?
- Why is sleep disorder a problem in workplaces?
- What gap currently exists that the dashboard addresses?
- What specific challenges do organisations face when dealing with sleep-related risks?
- What health problems is the project trying to reduce or prevent?
- What is the main problem this dashboard solves for employees?
  
## Methodology:
To evaluate Occupational Sleep Disorder & Health Risk project, the dataset was downloaded as excel file from kaggle.com and following excel features were incorporated:
- Power query
- Power pivot
- Pivot table
- Charts and Bar
- Multi-level filter system and intuitive layout

## Data Collection and Preparation:
- I imported raw datasets as excel from kaggle.com
- I cleaned and transformed data using Power Query (removing duplicates, correcting data types, handling null values).
- I used Power Pivot to calculate measures and create custom metrics such as Ave.sleep, Ave.age, Ave. sleep duration, Ave. sleep quality etc. 
## Reporting and Visualization:
- Built PivotTables and Pivot Charts for interactive reporting.
- Enabled slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.

  ## Visualization:
The Occupational Sleep Disorder & Health Risk Dashboard provides an easy-to-understand view of how employees are sleeping and how their sleep patterns may affect their health and work performance. It highlights sleep quality, potential health risks, and trends over time, helping organizations quickly identify workers who may need support to stay healthy, alert, and productive.

 ## Analysis:
 ### What problem is the Occupational Sleep Disorder & Health Risk Dashboard trying to solve?
- The dashboard aims to solve the challenge of detecting and monitoring sleep-related risks among employees, which often go unnoticed. Many workers experience sleep deprivation, insomnia, or irregular sleep patterns, which directly affects productivity, safety, and long-term health though organizations lack a centralized tool to identify these risks early.
 ### Why is sleep disorder a problem in workplaces?
- Sleep disorders lead to reduced concentration, slower reaction times, poor decision-making, higher stress, and increased accident risks. For industries like transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and safety-sensitive professions, these risks could result in injuries, costly errors, or fatal accidents.
 ### What gap currently exists that the dashboard addresses?
- Many workplaces collect health data but lack an integrated system that analyzes sleep behavior, correlates it to health risks, and provides actionable insights. The dashboard fills this gap by combining sleep metrics, fatigue scores, and health indicators in one accessible platform.
### What specific challenges do organisations face when dealing with sleep-related risks?
- Lack of awareness among staff and managers
- No real-time data to monitor fatigue or sleep quality
- Limited tools to predict health risks linked to poor sleep
- Difficulty identifying high-risk employees before incidents occur
### What health problems is the project trying to reduce or prevent?
- Workplace accidents due to fatigue
- Chronic diseases like hypertension and obesity
- Burnout and mental health decline
- Long-term productivity loss and absenteeism
### What is the main problem this dashboard solves for employees?
- It helps employees understand their sleep behavior, identify early symptoms of disorders, and get personalised recommendations to improve their health, well-being, and productivity.

## Key Summary Metrics and Key Insights
- Average Age: 42.18
- Total Respondents: 374
- Average Sleep Duration: 7.1 hours
- Average Sleep Quality: 7 (which is on a scale of 1–10)
- Average Stress Level: 5
- Average Physical Activity Score: 59
- Average Heart Rate: 70 bpm
- Average Daily Steps: 6,817
 
 ## Sleep Disorders by Occupation
### Top affected professions:
Nurses (73) and Doctors (71) are most affected which suggests high healthcare-related stress/workload.
Engineers (63) and Lawyers (47) also show high incidence possibly due to cognitive load and long work hours.
## Sleep Disorder Types
- None: 219
- Sleep Apnea: 78
- Insomnia: 77
This shows that nearly 40% suffer from sleep disorders, indicating a major wellness concern.
## Blood Pressure Distribution
- Stage 1 Hypertension: 140
- Stage 2 Hypertension: 71
- Elevated BP: 77
- Normal Pressure: 45
- Low Pressure: 41
showing over 75% of individuals having elevated to severe hypertension, signaling widespread cardiovascular risk.
## BMI Status
- Normal: 216
- Overweight: 148
- Obese: 10 (Majority are within a healthy range, but 42% are overweight or obese highlighting the risk factor for sleep apnea and hypertension.
## Gender Distribution
- There is a stable balanced: 189 females, 185 males showing no immediate gender-based bias in data.
## Physical Activity Levels
- Low Activity: 223
- High Activity: 151
  This shows that over 60% reports low physical activity, which may contribute to sleep, BMI, and BP issues.
