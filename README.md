## Introduction:
This is an Excel project report which provides a comprehensive analysis of sleep patterns, health risks, and lifestyle behaviors across various occupations. This project will help us analyze sleep disorders and their contributing factors across different occupation and health conditions. It offers data-driven insights into sleep disorders, blood pressure levels, BMI, physical activity, and stress, enabling healthcare professionals, HR teams, and wellness coordinators to make informed decisions regarding employee health and workplace wellness programs.The goal is to help organizations understand how workplace conditions influence employee health and to support data-driven wellness interventions.
## Project overview:
Sleep disorders and poor sleep quality contribute to reduced productivity, workplace errors, mental fatigue, and long-term health risks.This dashboard provides a holistic view of employee health by connecting sleep quality with lifestyle and occupational demands.The dataset includes 374 individuals across different professions with detailed demographic, sleep, and medical information.
## Problem statements:

## Methodology:
To evaluate Occupational Sleep Disorder & Health Risk project, the dataset was downloaded as excel file from kaggle.com and following excel features were incorporated:
- Power query
- Power pivot
- Pivot table
- Charts and Bar
- Multi-level filter system and intuitive layout

## Data Collection and Preparation:
- I imported raw datasets as excel from kaggle.com
- I cleaned and transformed data using Power Query (removing duplicates, correcting data types, handling null values).
- I used Power Pivot to calculate measures and create custom metrics such as Ave.sleep, Ave.age, Ave. sleep duration, Ave. sleep quality etc. 
## Reporting and Visualization:
- Built PivotTables and Pivot Charts for interactive reporting.
- Enabled slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.

  ## Visualization:
The Occupational Sleep Disorder & Health Risk Dashboard provides an easy-to-understand view of how employees are sleeping and how their sleep patterns may affect their health and work performance. It highlights sleep quality, potential health risks, and trends over time, helping organizations quickly identify workers who may need support to stay healthy, alert, and productive.
